# Foundations of Data-Management

Informatics Course in USC Applied Data Science

### INF-551     

### Instructor: Wensheng Wu

### Python, MySQL, MongoDB, HADOOP, Spark, HTML, CSS, JAVA 

## Course Description
The course may be divided into three parts. 

(1) Fundamental of data management: data storage, file system, file format, relational data vs. semi-structured data such as XML and JSON, conceptual modeling, relational modeling, relational algebra, SQL, views, constraints, query processing and optimization. 

(2) Big data analytics: NoSQL, key-value and document stores, cloud data storage, distributed file system, and MapReduce. 

(3) Advanced topics in data management (if time permits): data warehousing, data cleaning, and data integration. The course will also provide students with hand-on experiences on RDBMS, e.g., MySQL, NoSQL & cloud databases such as Google Firebase, Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB, and big data solution stacks, e.g., Apache Hadoop and Spark.
